Adds the output of the Multisite Language Switcher to the one (or more) of your navigation menu(s)

== Description ==

Most people are likely to use some lines of PHP or the widget provided by the [Multisite Language Switcher](http://wordpress.org/plugins/multisite-language-switcher/) to integrate the links to the translations in their blogs.

But this can lead to fatal errors if you don't know much about PHP, or maybe the dynamic sidebars are not the best place in your opinion. If you want to integrate the *Multisite Language Switcher* in one (or more) of your Navigation Menu(s) then you should give **MslsMenu** a try. 

== Installation ==

* Download the plugin and uncompress it with your preferred unzip programme
* Copy the entire directory in your plugin directory of your WordPress blog (/wp-content/plugins)
* You will find the configuration of the plugin once in each blog in Settings -> Multisite Language Switcher

== Screenshots ==
